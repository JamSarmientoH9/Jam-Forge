   - **Recommendations:** Use a dictionary to store character counts.

8. **Sum of Numbers**
   - **Description:** Create a function that sums all integers from 1 to a given number.
   - **Recommendations:** Use a `for` loop to iterate and accumulate the sum.

9. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - **Description:** Implement a function that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
   - **Recommendations:** Use a loop to calculate the sequence or recursion for a more advanced approach.

10. **Palindrome Checker**
    - **Description:** Develop a program that checks if a text string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
    - **Recommendations:** Compare the string with its reverse using slicing.

## Intermediate Level

1. **Sort a List**
   - **Description:** Create a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending or descending order.
   - **Recommendations:** Implement sorting algorithms like bubble sort or insertion sort.

2. **Hangman Game**
   - **Description:** Develop a hangman game where the user guesses letters in a secret word.
   - **Recommendations:** Use lists to represent guessed letters and missing letters, and control failed attempts.

3. **BMI Calculator**
   - **Description:** Create a calculator that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and classifies the physical state.
   - **Recommendations:** Use mathematical formulas and conditionals to classify BMI.

4. **Contact List Manager**
   - **Description:** Develop a simple system to add, remove, and search contacts in an address book.
   - **Recomendations:** Use a dictionary to store contacts and functions to manage the address book.

5. **CSV File Analyzer**
   - **Description:** Implement a program that reads and analyzes data from a CSV file, and shows basic statistics.
   - **Recommendations:** Use the `csv` module to read files and perform analysis.

6. **Task Manager**
   - **Description:** Create a command-line application to add, remove, and list pending tasks.
   - **Recommendations:** Implement a simple interface using menus and lists to manage tasks.

7. **Currency Converter**
   - **Description:** Develop a currency converter that converts between various currencies using exchange rates.
   - **Recommendations:** Allow the user to select the currency and use predefined exchange rates.

8. **Caesar Cipher**
   - **Description:** Implement an encoder and decoder using the Caesar cipher, which shifts characters in the alphabet.
   - **Recommendations:** Use modulo operations for character shifting.

9. **Word Finder in Text**
   - **Description:** Create a program that searches for a specific word in a text and counts how many times it appears.
   - **Recommendations:** Use string methods like `find()` and `count()`.

10. **Multiplication Table Generator**
    - **Description:** Develop a program that generates the multiplication table of a number specified by the user.
    - **Recommendations:** Use a `for` loop to calculate and display the table.

## Advanced Level

1. **Inventory System**
   - **Description:** Implement an inventory system with functions to add, remove, and query items, and track stock levels.
   - **Recommendations:** Use classes to represent items and store data in structures like lists or dictionaries.

2. **Sudoku Solver**
   - **Description:** Create a Sudoku solver that can solve given Sudoku puzzles.
   - **Recommendations:** Implement a search algorithm like backtracking to solve the puzzle.

3. **Banking System Simulation**
   - **Description:** Develop a simple banking system with operations for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
   - **Recommendations:** Use classes to represent bank accounts and handle exceptions for invalid operations.

4. **Web Scraper**
   - **Description:** Implement a scraper that collects data from a web page and stores it in a file or database.
   - **Recommendations:** Use libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for data collection and analysis.

5. **Chatbot with Automatic Responses**
   - **Description:** Create a chatbot that responds to frequently asked questions using a predefined set of responses.
   - **Recommendations:** Use data structures like dictionaries to map questions to responses.

6. **Dice Roll Simulator**
   - **Description:** Develop a simulator for rolling dice and calculating statistics such as average and frequency of results.
   - **Recommendations:** Use the `random` module to simulate dice rolls and perform statistical analysis.

7. **Recommendation System**
